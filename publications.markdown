My research interests lie at the interface between statistical physics, and computer science. 
I analyze high-dimensional optimization and inference problems, with the aim of understanding what are the properties responsible for their computational limits. 

You can find a list of my publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=QQtOq2EAAAAJ&hl=fr)

And my PhD thesis <a href="https://louisebudzynski.github.io/docs/PhDThesis.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
