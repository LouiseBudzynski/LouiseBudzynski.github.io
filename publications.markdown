My research interests lie at the interface between statistical physics and computer science, with a focus on high-dimensional optimization and inference problems. 
I am currently working on:
- Computational and information-theoretic limits of Bayesian inference problems with structured signal
- Understanding how high-dimensional energy landscapes are explored by local dynamics
- Re-weighting strategies to enhance algorithmic performances on high-dimensional optimization problems 

My PhD thesis is available <a href="https://louisebudzynski.github.io/docs/PhDThesis.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
